          <h2>Observations</h2>
          
          <h4>Groups of students at the library</h4>
          <p>
            Three students are studying together but silently at the library.
            All on their laptops, with their headphones on. One was typing code
            furiously on a website and had many tabs opened, while the two
            others were watching a lecture video in full screen mode and taking
            notes on paper. The student who was typing code suddenly starts
            laughing distracting the other two, now, curious to know what’s so
            funny. They pause their lecture video and take off their headphones.
            He turns his laptop around and they all start laughing together. A
            conversation sparks between them about funny internet references
            (memes) and they start sharing memes to each other. This goes on for
            a while as they even start showing each other funny youtube videos
            and telling each other funny anecdotes.
          </p>
          <h4>Student in class</h4>
          <p>
            A student sitting at the front of the class is paying attention to
            the lecture. He is looking at the corresponding lecture slides on
            his laptop to follow along with the teacher and is typing notes on
            OneNote. Every while and then, he swipes to another screen, opens
            Messenger, answers some messages, closes it, and swipes back still
            trying to keep up with the lecture. However, the professor starts
            going on a tangent about a particular topic, and that student gets
            bored and loses focus. This time, he opens Facebook and starts
            scrolling on his News Feed while chatting with friends. He then goes
            on to open other tabs and completely loses track of the lecture
            until it ends.
          </p>
          <h4>Another Student in class</h4>
          <p>
            A student sitting at the back of the class is very distractedly
            paying attention to a lecture. She has a laptop open in front of
            her. She’s on messenger chatting with multiple friends and groups of
            friends. She has many tabs opened and goes back and forth between
            them very quickly, always coming back to messenger. Occasionally,
            she will raise her head to look at the board.
          </p>
          <h4>Student at a Cafe</h4>
          <p>
            A student is studying alone at a cafe. She has her webwork opened on
            her laptop and is writing her calculations on paper. She stares at
            her paper with her arms crossed, tries to write something, erases
            it, closes her eyes and sighs. She proceeds to open a new tab to go
            on Messenger to ask friends for help about the problem. She opens
            another tab to go on Instagram while she waits for friend’s reply.
            She starts by going through stories really rapidly and would
            occasionally pause and watch some stories for a while. Even when her
            friend replied, she dismissed the notification and continued
            watching the stories until she finally watched them all.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            From our observations, we noticed that the biggest distraction for
            students during moments that require intense focus, such as when
            they are studying or listening to lectures, are internet-connected
            laptops. More specifically, the problem resides in the convenience
            and subtlety that using a web browser on the laptop, especially for
            distraction and entertainment, provides. Indeed, because the
            majority of a student’s work needs the web, it is too convenient and
            effortless for them to lose focus by opening a new Facebook “tab”
            and scrolling through their news feed, to swipe left to a new window
            showing episodes of “The Office”, or to wander off on countless
            forms of entertainment and social media.
            <br /><br />
            This problem is further amplified by the subtlety of consuming
            entertainment or going on social media during lectures. In fact,
            when using a phone, the teacher can’t easily tell if the student is
            using his laptop to follow along with the lecture or to consume
            mundane web media. Therefore, the student doesn’t have any friction,
            in the form of guilt from not paying attention to the teacher, to go
            on Facebook and talk with his friends while the teacher is giving a
            lecture.
            <br /><br />
            Moreover, the student rarely notices that they are getting
            distracted for hours at a time. Most of the time, whenever the
            students opens a new tab on Instagram or Facebook, they are doing it
            unconsciously. In fact whenever a task gets boring or mentally
            taxing, the student is immediately inclined to open his favorite
            social website to get alter his emotions, which sometimes ends up in
            the student wasting hours throughout the day. However, in most
            cases, the student is completely aware that this behavior is a waste
            of time. They simply don’t realize it in the moment. Just like
            Tristan Harris, a design ethicist at Google, said in his TED talk
            <b>“How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every
            day”</b>: <i>“Right now it’s as if all of our technology is basically only
            asking our lizard brain what’s the best way to just impulsively get
            you to do the next tiniest thing with your time, instead of asking
            you in your life what we would be most time well spent for you.”</i> In
            the exact moment between focused work and opening a new tab for
            distraction, the student doesn’t have the built-in reflex to pause
            and think about what they’re getting themselves into, or why they
            feel the absolute need to distract themselves in that moment. The
            web is designed to provide them incentive to mindlessly wander off
            from their state of focus.

           </div>
            
            <br />
            In <b>“A call to Minimize Distraction”</b> , Harris explains that <i>“When
            access to the next hit is too frictionless, we lose the ability to
            consider before acting. [...] When we lose that moment to consider
            before acting on our impulses we lose what sets us apart from
            thinking humans.”</i> That “pause” is what gives use the ability to
            ponder, and it is what we want to give back to people. Through our
            product, in the form of a web plugin, we will insert a layer of
            friction between the state of focus and the state of distraction by
            prompting the user with the question “Why?” whenever they are about
            to open a new tab recognized as being distracting and unproductive.
            It is important to notice that our goal is not to block the user
            from accessing a distraction, but to let the user think and evaluate
            his web usage for himself. We believe that this layer, which gives
            the user a second to think about their behavior, is the missing key
            required for our users to allow themselves to remain focused on
            their work.

          <br />
          <h4>Persona 1: Angela, the Socialite</h4>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img src="img/Angela.png" alt="Angela" width="50%" height="" />
          <p><b>Figure 2: </b> Angela, the Socialite</p>
        </div>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Angela is a University student in her freshman year studying
            Mechanical Engineering. She loves going out with her friends and
            sharing her life on social media. Her instagram account has over a
            thousand followers, she even has an app that notifies her whenever
            she loses followers. It’s really important for her to keep up with
            the amount of followers she has, and even gain followers. She spends
            a lot of time crafting her next post, and uploading new stories.
            However University’s workload is much heavier than what she is used
            to. She needs to spend more time on readings and assignments, but
            has trouble controlling her urges to be on social media. When she
            studies, she gives her phone to someone else so they can hide it,
            but since most of her work is on the web, she uses a laptop and
            keeps on opening her social media every few minutes mindlessly, even
            if there’s nothing new.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Persona 2: Nicolas, the Bro</h4>

          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Nicolas is a University student in his senior year studying Nursing.
            He loves partying, spending time with his “bros”, playing sports,
            going to the gym. He doesn’t really care about social media as he
            likes to live in the moment. However, he loves being on reddit and
            youtube. Him and his friends constantly send each other funny
            pictures from reddit or funny videos found on youtube. Once a
            picture or video is clicked, Nicolas gets trapped in an endless loop
            of infinite scrolling which takes away a lot of his time, leaving
            him with no more time for things he really cares about. He strongly
            believes that it’s not about not having enough time for certain
            things, but rather about them not being priorities. He tries as much
            as possible to resist the temptation, but it’s become a habit to
            pull out his phone and go on reddit/youtube whenever he’s bored. He
            started putting away his phone when studying, but the biggest
            difficulty is still resisting to click on his favorite bookmarked
            site : reddit.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Joseph is a PhD student doing research on Quantum Physics while working part-time at IBM. He follows a tight schedule to balance his work and social life. Hence it is really important for him to be able to use his time efficiently and is always looking for ways to optimize his productivity. The only social platform that can get him distracted is WhatsApp. He finds himself constantly going on it and spending hours talking to his friends.

          <p>
            Angela comes back from school and gets ready to start studying. She
            opens her laptop and the first page she opens is Facebook. The
            plugin that she has already installed redirects her to the question
            “Why?”. She pauses and squints. She doesn’t know why. She proceeds
            on reading the three options that are offered to her. Is it because
            it’s a priority? No, her midterm is her priority. Is it because she
            NEEDS it? No, she needs to study. Or because it’s productive? She
            closes the page.

            <br /><br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> In this use case, upon being redirected to the
            question “Why?” Angela had time to realized by herself that she did
            not have valid reasons to go on Facebook and that she had more
            important things to do instead. This is of course the main success
            scenario. The following use cases will address situations where it
            does not go as planned.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Use case 2</h4>
          <p>
            Angela is in class and find herself so bored by the lecture that she
            started daydreaming. Instead, she decides to go on her social media
            (might as well, since she is not paying attention anyways). She
            already knows that she is going to be prompted with the question
            “Why?”. She picks a random choice and accesses her social media.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> Even though Angela was able to access a source of
            distraction, the important thing is that she made a mindful
            decision. She is also less likely to turn off completely the plugin
            because it still gives her access to what she wants. It’s something
            that adds just enough friction so that it doesn’t become annoying.
            It’s something that can be integrated on the long-term, and not only
            activated during desperate moments such as midterms and finals
            season.
          </p>

          <h4>Use case 3</h4>
          <p>
            Nicolas occasionally wakes up early in the morning. Every time he
            does, he spends the entire time watching youtube in his bed until he
            has to go to class. This morning, upon waking up, still groggy, he
            directly reached for his laptop and opens up Youtube. His eyes
            adjusting from the brightness of his screen, he suddenly sees a big
            “Why?” displayed. He pauses, murmurs “Why?” and answers himself with
            “because I want to”. More awake now, he reads the three options and
            realizes that he needs to choose one in order to access Youtube. Is
            it his priority? No, he could go on a morning run. Is it because he
            NEEDS it? No, there’s many more important things he needs, like
            eating breakfast, catching up on missed lectures, washing two weeks
            old dishes. Is it because it is productive? Sleeping would probably be more productive than that. He closes his laptop and goes back to sleep.
			<br /><br />
            
            <b>Explanation:</b>In this use case, Nicolas realizes that he could be doing something better than going on Youtube. He was the one controlling the choices on his menus (“How Technology is Hijacking Your mind - From a Magician and a Google Design Ethicist”, Tristan Harris). 
 

            
          </p>

          <br />
          <h4>Use case 4</h4>
          <p>
				Joseph gets to work early to workout in the building’s gym. After his workout, he eats breakfast with his coworkers and gets to work. During work hours he rarely gets distracted as him and his team all sit next to each other in an open space; it would make him look bad and he has deadlines to meet. After work, he goes home, cooks supperm prepares his lunch for the next day and heads to the library for the rest of the night. His goal for the night is to finish writing the lab report for his recent experiment as he knows he won’t have time for the rest of the week. He shuts down his cellphone, open his laptop and starts working. He goes on the web and searches for references to support claims he’s making in his report. He opens one tab after the other, reads numerous articles, goes back and forth between his browser and his document, and suddenly opens the WhatsApp webpage. Usually he ends up spending a considerable amount of time chatting with his friends, before realizing it. He always ends up asking himself “How did I even got here?” However this time, he was prompted with the question “Why?” and right away, closed his browser.
			<br /><br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> In this case, for a productivity junky like Joseph, having that moment of friction puts him back on track without him even needing to read the three options.

          <h4>Alternative 1: BlockSite, and similar website blockers</h4>
          <br />
          
          <b>Description:</b> BlockSite is a very popular chrome extension (and
          also mobile app) that can block the user from opening websites that
          they select themselves in the settings. They can set the blocking
          behaviour to follow a schedule, and add a layer of security with a
          password which they would have to provide to unblock websites.
          <br><br>

              </div>
          
          <br />
          <b>Similarities:</b> BlockSite provides a similar layer of friction to
          our product by preventing the user from accessing a distracting
          website immediately <br /><br />
          <b>Limitations:</b> BlockSite’s layer of friction is very lackluster
          since it can be easily bypassed by entering a password. Even if the
          password is set to be extremely long, the user can simply delete the
          extension or reset their password through their email. Furthermore,
          the extension doesn’t give the user any insight on their behavior or
          why they want to access blocked websites. It is merely a substitute
          for self-discipline, and leaves the user susceptible to distractions
          on devices that don’t have this extension downloaded. It also takes
          away the student’s sense of freedom by blocking them from doing what
          they feel like they want. This is a sure way to irritate the user and
          make them delete the extension in the long-term.

          <h4>Alternative 2: Forest, and other rewarding substitutes</h4>
          <br />
          <b>Description:</b> Forest is a Chrome extension (and also mobile app)
          that allows the user to stay focused by growing a virtual garden of
          trees for 25 minutes at a time. When the user wants to stay focused, they plant a tree. The
          tree grows for as long as they work and fully grows after 25 minutes of uninterrupted work. However, when a user accesses a
          website on the blacklist, the tree dies. <br /><br />

          </div>
            

          <b>Similarities:</b> Much like our proposal, this extension serves as
          psychological friction layer between the user and the distracting
          website. Whenever the user wants to access a blacklisted website, the
          pain of losing their work (of growing the tree) ideally overcomes
          their urge, and they remain focused <br /><br />
          <b>Limitations:</b> Although this extension uses a similar layer of
          friction as our product (i.e. psychological), it doesn’t provide the
          user with any insight on their behavior, much like BlockSite.
          Rewarding the user for not getting distracted is a nice substitute for
          their general lack of focus on the web. However, this extension
          doesn’t provide the user the same benefit of knowing why they behave
          this way. It doesn’t allow them to wonder why they opened a new tab on
          Facebook and let their trees die. It simply makes them feel sad
          whenever they get distracted, in hopes that they will eventually stop
          distracting themselves. Instead, our extension will allow the user to
          ponder on their behavior, and decide for themselves if they are going
          on a distracting website mindfully or mindlessly.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Comparing Products</h2>
          There are a plethora of extensions and plugins that allow the user to
          either prevent themselves from accessing websites (i.e. Blocksite) or
          help themselves provide motivation for time spent off distracting
          websites (i.e. Forest). These extensions generally help the user
          reduce their time spent on distracting websites, as well as the
          frequency at which they access websites. However, they all have a
          major drawback. They are all short term solutions. They don’t provide
          the user with any insight on their distracted behavior or any reason
          for the user to question their patterns whenever they end up on a
          distracting website.

          <br /><br />
          For example, Blocksite, although convenient at preventing the Nicolas
          from accessing entertainment websites altogether, quickly becomes
          irritating when Nicolas is in a distracted state and wants to get a
          quick rush from scrolling through social media. When the user is in
          this state, they are vulnerable to delete the extension altogether and
          never install it again. On the other hand, our extension allows the
          user to access whatever website they want, whenever they want, but
          instead simply allows the user to question why they want to go on a
          particular website, giving them just a moment to think about their
          behavior and giving them the chance to correct it if they want to. We
          believe that this sense of freedom is crucial for the long term usage
          of an extension that is meant to correct the distracted behavior
          altogether.

          <br /><br />
          Moreover, our extension is superior to extensions that reward the user
          for time spent off of distracting websites, like Forest, because it
          allows the user to learn and improve their focus based on their
          patterns of failure, rather than simply substituting the reward of
          going on social media by another virtual reward (such as trees).
          Instead of attempting to lure Angela towards a virtual reward, our
          extension will allow her to develop their self-reflection skills and
          make her aware of her web consumption whenever she opens a new tab.
          Since she already knows that going on these websites is going to waste
          her precious work time, she will likely make the decision to avoid
          going on them whenever she is prompted of the consciousness of her
          act. In the long-run, this self-reflection will allow the user to have
          the reflex of being mindful, and not open new tabs unconsciously, even
          on devices that don’t have this plugin installed.
          <br />

          <h2>Designing at a high-level</h2>
          <br />
          <div class="text-center">
          <img src="img/diagram.png" alt="Diagram" width="" height="" />
          <p><b>Figure 5: </b> High-level diagram of the Chrome Extension "Mindful"</p>
          </div>
          <br />
          The design of our extension would be pretty simple. We would need to
          build a Chrome extension, as well as a database to hold the user data,
          as demonstrated on the diagram. Since most computer users already have
          the Chrome Browser installed, the user would simply need to install
          the extension on their device to use it. When they install it, they
          would set their settings (i.e. blocked websites), which would be
          stored in the database. Then, whenever they want to access one of
          these websites through Chrome, the extension would detect if the
          website is blacklisted, and if so, would prompt the user the question
          "Why?, before redirecting them to the page they wanted to access.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Justifying feasibility</h2>
          <p>
            Although this extension will be a challenge to build, we believe
            that our team has the appropriate skills to take on this challenge.
            We know for a fact that building such an extension is feasible to
            begin with based on BlockSite, which is already able to redirect the
            user to another web page. Furthermore, Chrome provides developers
            with many APIs and extensive documentation, giving us a lot of
			resources to learn from. 
			
			<br> <br>The estimate required time effort is at
            least 30 hours of work per person. Since we have never built a
            chrome extension before, a big part of the time will be dedicated to
			researching and learning how this technology works. 
			<br> <br>
			To successfully build this extension, we will need UI/UX, frontend development and
            backend development skills. It will also require someone proficient
            in the programming languages used for this project, which are
            Javascript, HTML/CSS, MongoDB and Node.js. Both of our team members
            have sufficient knowledge in these technologies as Software
            Engineering students.
