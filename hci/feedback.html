          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            In summary, we completed all pre and post test questionnaires that
            will be used to analyse the evaluation goals in the “Results and
            Analysis” section of this document, as well as all data that was
            required to analyze the usability goals of this system. In brief,
            the error rate for the tasks in the testing phase was less than 1
            per task on average, and all users spent less than 3 minutes on
            average on all the tasks. Furthermore, the users were almost all
            satisfied with the look and feel of the application, as well as its
            purpose and use cases, which were gathered from the Pre and Post
            test questionnaire. These will be used to evaluate the Nielsen’s
            heuristics later on. You can find elaborate results in these
            documents below:

          <h4>Test 1: Emily</h4>

          <p>
            Emily loves using her tablet to watch her favorite Disney Princesses
            movies. She also often uses it to call her friends, or to film funny
            videos of her pranking the cat. She knows she spends too much time
            on her tablet because her mom keeps on reminding her. She’s excited
            at the idea that she can trade some of her tablet time for candies
            and other sweets.

          <br />
          <h4>Test 2: Catherine</h4>
          <p>
            Emily’s mother. Knows that her daughter spends a lot of time on her
            device and tries to remind her to get off of it (especially during
            school nights). Emily sometimes listens and sometimes doesn’t. Wants
            her daughter to be autonomous, so never confiscates the device.
            Emily is a sweet girl and does well at school, so she doesn’t really
            see the harm in letting her use the device, although she wishes she
            could use it less.

          <h4>Test 3: Adrian</h4>
          <p>
            7 year old boy with diagnosed ADHD. Adrian spends most of his time
            on his iPad playing games and watching youtube videos. His parents
            have tried reducing his screen time by restricting it at certain
            hours or by completely taking it away, but to no avail. Adrian still
            seeks to spend most of his time on his screen, and wouldn’t rather
            do much else.

          <h4>Test 4: Zahra</h4>
          <p>
            Stay at home mom. Zahra is extremely aware that she wastes a lot of
            time on her phone, and knows that this is bad, but doesn’t do
            anything about it. She’s even tried limiting Adrian’s (7year old
            son) screen usage by restricting it at certain hours or by
            completely taking away the IPad or IPhone, but none of these
            persistently changed the child’s behavior, nor made the child “want”
            to spend less time on screens.

          <h4>Similarities and Differences</h4>
          <h5>Similarities</h5>
          <p>
            Both parents that were tested had problems with the same components,
            such as creating an account as well as logging out. The same was
            noticed for the children, where logging in and out were both easy,
            but both didn’t really understand what their dashboard meant.
          </p>
          <h5>Differences</h5>
          <p>
            How they reacted faced with the obstacle was different. For example,
            Zahra was used to spend time on her phone, especially on polished
            applications like Facebook and Instagram, therefore she had a much
            higher expectation for TimeTken. She expected the application to
            work perfectly and would easily get frustrated. On the other hand,
            Catherine was more lenient and would poke around and ask questions
            when she didn’t understand a function. As for children, the
            children’s predisposition to mobile application significantly
            affected their usability tests. For example, Adrian was already very
            addicted to is screen, so he didn’t care about using this
            application. On the other hand, emily was more open to understanding
            and using the application.

                explained in the app and many of the users we tested could not

                Adrian couldn’t remember his password to login and had to ask
                the evaluator to remind him what his password was. This could
                render the entire app useless to the children, and if they can’t
                see their progress, they wouldn’t use the app at all. An
                auto-login feature should exist, or no passwords for child
                account.

                The account creating page affords creating a “child” account as
                well as a parent account, but the distinction between the two is
                misleading and frustrating, as observed by both parents that
                were tested.

                The user manual is mainly addressing the parents of the
                application. The children in our tests could not understand the
                vocabulary in the manual if they needed help with the
                application. It would be likely that the parent would have to
                explain to the children how to use the application, which is not
                efficient.

          <h2>Test Plan Critique</h2>
          <p>
            Overall, the test plan was effective at gathering data that could be
            used to determine if the usability goals and the usability
            heuristics from Nielsen’s list were met.For example, it was very easy to determine if the time criteria, number of errors, and visual appeal goals of the application were met through the usability evaluation plan proposed. However, our team quickly noticed that we there
            was a major component missing to the test plan. In fact, the user
            population of the test plan does not include parents, which would
            use the app the most. It only specifically targets children.
            Therefore, in order to correctly measure the goals and heuristics,
            we decided to test it on actual parents. We determined that this was
            extremely important because the parents are the one thats are mostly
            targeted by the Nielsen’s heuristics proposed, as well as being the
            main users of this application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, we noticed that the vocabulary in the children
            questionnaires was too complicated for a child to be able to fill it
            out on his own, and many questions did not serve any purpose to test
            the usability goals, such as "How strictly would you monitor your
            hypothetical child's screen time?” “How strictly do you currently
            monitor/restrict your screen usage?” and “How strictly did you
            monitor/restrict you screen usage as a young teen or child?”. In
            fact, we created completely new Pre
            (https://forms.gle/J19XFkjP1EFSjQ9VA) and Post
            (https://forms.gle/H9tFXgHbDZwXTpn28) questionnaires to address the
            usability goals more efficiently. The test script was also too
            complicated to address children, therefore we had to use a boiled
            down version which was more suited to their vocabulary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other minor improvements include replacing the “start time” and “end
            time” of the benchmark tasks with a “time elapsed” heuristic, which
            made it easier to collect data with a stopwatch. Moreover, we
            included an option to make 0 errors in the data collection sheet
            provided, because sometimes users did not make any errors, and this
            should be recorded in order to effectively represent if the
            usability heuristics are met. Lastly, we had to determine that 8/10
            would be a good score for the visual usability goal, since no
            quantitative goal was provided by the team, although it required it.

          <h2>Design Critique</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Below, we've written our design suggestions for each of the usability issues
            mentioned above.
          </p>
          
          <table>
            <th>Usability issue</th>
            <th>Severity</th>
            <th>Recomendation</th>
            <tr>
              <td>
                The app does not display information effectively to the user.
              </td>
              <td>High</td>
              <td>
                Since children don’t have a large vocabulary and don’t know about jargon. Hence instead of writing, we suggest adding
                images.
                <ol>
                  <li>For the progress, instead of displaying a percentage number, a progress bar would be more meaningful.</li>
                  <li>For the amount of tokens, writing “500 out of 1800” would be clearer than “500/1800”. Instead of “TT” as units, the logo
                of a coin with TT on it would suffice.
                If “500 ouf of 1800” is not aesthetically pleasing, then many other options are possible, such as having a progress bar,
                or having “GOAL: 1800” at the top center of the page and “Your coins: 500” after.</li>
                </ol>

              <td>Children can’t remember their passwords</td>
              <td>High</td>
              <td>
                Although phones are capable of storing passwords, we won’t make the assumption that the child knows how it works. An easy solution would be to give the parents access to the passwords such that if the child forgets, the parent can remind him.

                  <li>Another way that would be a lot more effective, is to directly incorporate it into the app.
