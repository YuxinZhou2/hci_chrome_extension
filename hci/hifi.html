          <h2>Design Evolution</h2>

          <!-- <h4>
            “On/Off” Setting added to enable and disable the extension at hand
          </h4>
          <p>
            Many of our evaluators expressed that they would like the option to
            enable and disable the extension from the setting popup, because
            they would find it irritating to always have the extension enabled,
            and they don’t want to have to delete the extension every time they
            have days off.
          </p> -->

          <h4>Prompt” tab in settings reduced usability, removed.</h4>
          <p>
            Initially, we had designed a “prompt” tab in the settings menu so
            that the user could personalize the question bank and add their own
            questions that they wanted displayed in the app popups. Through our
            testing and feedback, we noticed that many people didn’t understand
            what we meant by “prompt” and that when we explained it to them,
            they didn’t seem to understand nor need this feature, which is why
            we removed it in the high-fidelity prototype.
          </p>

          <h4>Allowed access to website after wrong answer.</h4>
          <p>
            Many of our evaluators expressed that they were getting irritated
            when they answered the question wrong and weren’t given access to
            the website they wanted to access. They expressed that they felt
            “forced” to answer, and that this would lead them to uninstall the
            app after a few attempts and wrong answers.
          </p>

          <h4>“Keep Learning” button changed to “Another Question”</h4>
          <p>
            Some of our evaluators expressed that the “Keep Learning” button
            displayed after answering the question right was misleading, and
            that they didn’t know if it meant that it would redirect them to a
            previous page where they were learning, or that it would give them
            another question to answer, which is what we intended it for. To
            increase usability and comprehension, we simply changed this button
            to “Another Question”.
          </p>

          <h4>Settings button removed from Main popup to avoid confusion</h4>
          <p>
            When we asked our evaluators how they would access the settings,
            nearly all of them decided to click the chrome extension button
            displayed on the top right corner of the browser. Almost none of
            them clicked the settings button displayed on the popup page, and
            some thought that the placement of the settings button in the bottom
            right was misleading and confused it for a “Continue” button. We
            removed this button entirely to increase usability.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Additional information added to “Repeat interval” and “# Questions”
            settings
          </h4>
          <p>
            Many of our evaluators did not understand what the purpose of the
            “Repeat interval” and “# Questions” settings were. To clarify its
            purpose, we decided to add an information popup when the user hovers
            over the app so that it would explain their purpose, which increases
            usability.

          <br />
          <h2>User population</h2>
          <p>
            The user population for our application consists of primarily
            university students working on their personal computers, since
            they’re prone to having a lot of work to do and many reasons to get
            distracted from said work while they’re navigating the web.
            Although, any student who is studying on their personal computer
            would be a good candidate for our user population, these students
            would ideally fit into the three personas described in our proposal
            (i.e. “Angela, the Socialite”, “the Bro” or “Joseph, the
            Productivity Junky”). Please refer to these in our proposal to get
            an idea of who to test the application on. Furthermore, the user
            population should be familiar with the Chrome Browser, and
            comfortable with adding extensions to the browser to increase their
            productivity. The user population shouldn’t be using a public
            computer, since it is unlikely that they are willing to add
            extensions to the Chrome Browser.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Usability goals</h2>
          <h4>
            The task required before accessing the blocked website is feasible
          </h4>
          <p>
            The user can access the website they desired after going through the
            application (yes/no).
          </p>

          <h4>The user can easily navigate the application</h4>
          <p>
            The user doesn’t take longer than 20 seconds to find the settings
            page.
          </p>

          <h4>
            The user can easily understand what task they have to do to access
            their blocked website
          </h4>
          <p>
            The user answers the question under 60 seconds the first time they
            use the app.
          </p>

          <h4>
            The task required before accessing the blocked website isn’t too
            easy
          </h4>
          <p>The user takes at least 10 seconds to complete the task.</p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Usability Test Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            The following questions will help you set up the usability
            procedure:
          </p>

          <h4>How many examiners are required?</h4>
          <p>
            For this application, two examiners will be required. One examiner
            will tell the user what to do, and the other will time the tasks and
            take notes on the user’s comments.
          </p>

          <h4>What equipment will the examiners need?</h4>
          <p>
            For equipment, you will need a laptop with internet access, as well
            as our application “Mindful” installed on the Chrome browser. To
            install “Mindful”, please refer to the steps outlined in the User
            Manual above.
          </p>
          <h4>How should your prototype be handled? (manual/documentation)</h4>
          <p>
            The prototype should be activated through the chrome extension and
            ready for the user to use. To make sure that the application works.
            Please ensure that the application appears when you go on
            “facebook.com”. To get a thorough usage guide of the application,
            please refer to the User Manual.
          </p>
          <h4>How will you instruct your examiners to proceed?</h4>
          <p>
            The examiners should introduce the user to the application by
            telling them the purpose of the application. The following template
            will suffice:
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            “Mindful is a Chrome Extension which allows the user to set a layer
            between themselves and distracting websites. This layer takes the
            form of questions that are asked the user before accessing the
            website, so that the user is reminded that this website is
            distracting, as well as improving lateral knowledge that they would
            otherwise not have time to improve”
          </p>

          <p>Then, tell the user the purpose of this test:</p>
          <p class="lead">
            “The purpose of this test is to evaluate the usability of the
            application, and determine if it is intuitive and easy to use based
            on a few criteria. It’s important to note that it is the application
            that is being evaluated, and not the user.”
          </p>
          <p>Lastly, tell the user to complete these tasks, and time them:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to the application settings.</li>
            <li>Add “facebook.com” to the list of blacklisted websites.</li>
            <li>Try to access “facebook.com”.</li>
            <li>Complete the task required.</li>
            <li>Try to get another question to answer</li>
            <li>
              Try to get to the front page of facebook.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>
            How should the examiners treat the test subjects, what should they
            tell them?
          </h4>
          <p>
            The examiners should emphasize to the test subjects that is the
            application that is being evaluated, not them. This is to ensure
            that the user feels comfortable and doesn’t feel inadequate when
            they make errors. They examiner should emphasize that if the user
            makes an error, it will ensure that these errors don’t reoccur when
            the application is built.
          </p>
          <h4>What should the examiners avoid doing?</h4>
          <p>
            The examiners should avoid influencing the subjects or guide them in
            any way to complete the tasks required, other than a high-level
            instruction of what the tasks are (as instructed in the list above.
          </p>
          <h4>What should the examiners avoid telling the test subjects?</h4>
          <p>
            At any point, the examiner should avoid telling the user how to
            complete the task. For example, if the user asks “where is the
            settings page?", the examiner shouldn’t tell them where it is.
          </p>
          <h4>What/How/When should the examiners measure?</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout each test, the examiner should measure how much time it
            takes the user to complete each task, which are directly related to
            the usability goals, and take notes on any additional comments the
            test subjects have on the features of the application, as well as
            whenever they find the application confusing or irritating.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Reporting</h2>
          <p>
            All throughout the tests, the examiners are required to take written
            notes about any comments, feedback, irritations and suggestions from
            the test subjects. It is important to take notes on all the little
            details, such as when a user hesitates before clicking a button, or
            when they ask questions because they don’t understand how to
            complete a task. No structure is required for these comments. As for
            the usability goals, the examiners are required to report a
            quantitative measure related to the usability goals in tabular form
            (as listed above, where appropriate), and indicate if the goals were
            met or not. It is important that the examiners write a possible
            justification or comment related to the user’s performance related
            to each goal, so that the implications of the test outcomes are
            highlighted.
          </p>

          <h2>Usability Evaluation</h2>
          <p>
            To evaluate our application, we will use the following heuristics
            three heuristics, i.e. “Visibility of system status”, “Recognition
            rather than recall” and “Aesthetic and minimalist design”, from
            Nielsen’s “10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design”, which
            correlate with our usability goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            These three heuristics are a central theme in all of our usability
            goals. Ideally, we want the user to be able to use the application
            quickly without ever having touched the user manual. This requires
            that all the functions of the application, including current status,
            to be easily visible, recognisable, as well as be very minimalistic
            in order for the user to not be able to understand what they have to
            do almost immediately. We never want the user to be overloaded and
            waste too much time reading instructions and understanding tasks,
            which would lead to them spending more time on the application than
            we had intended them to in our usability goals. For this reason, we
            tried our best to design and test our application through
            prototyping to be simple, intuitive and usable without any external
            help.
          </p>
          <p>
            The evaluation methodology to evaluate these heuristics is as
            follows. In order to test if we achieved our usability goals and
            conform to our three heuristics, we need our evaluators to time the
            user while they’re accomplishing all of the tasks indicated in the
            test procedure individually. Furthermore, we need them to take
            free-form notes on whenever the user is hesitating to complete each
            one of the tasks required, or when they’re confused and don’t
            understand what the system is asking them to do or what the task is.
            In the case that the user could not accomplish the task, they should
            also note down a justification of why the user couldn’t accomplish
            it. Once you have this time and comment data, you will use it to
            answer whether or not our usability goals and usability heuristics
            were complied with, and indicate your justification next to it.
