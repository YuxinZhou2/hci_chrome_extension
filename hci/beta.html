          <h2>Design Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            The beta system went through multiple evolutions and design changes
            that reflect the feedback received previously, as well as our own
            insights. The evolutions are as follows, in order of importance:
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>
            Evolution 1: Improved Aesthetics and Visuals
          </h4>
          <p>
            Throughout our testing with the hi-fi prototype and the alpha
            system, the most common complaint we received was regarding the
            visual appearance of our application. Most users notably claimed
            that even if the application worked pretty well, they would never
            use it in the alpha stage simply because it doesn’t look polished
            like the Chrome interface they are used to. Since one our our three
            main usability heuristics from Nielsen's list was
            <i>Aesthetic and minimalist design</i>, we decided that it would be
            important to address this usability issue in our beta stage. In
            fact, we completely rehauled the design of our application as you
            can see below, following the material design style. This includes a
            redesign of the system settings, as well as the layer that appears
            on blacklisted websites.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h4>Evolution 2: Custom Questions</h4>
          <p>
            During the Hi-Fi prototype testing, as well as further testing with
            users, we noticed that our users weren’t satisfied with the limited
            amount of question categories that were implemented at the time of
            the alpha stage. In order to make the system more usable to users
            and target a larger subset of our audience segments, which are
            students with access to computers, we decided to add custom
            questions to our application. Now the user can add as many
            categories of questions as well as custom questions as they like in
            order to match their preference, as well as make it optimally usable
            for themselves. This correlates and targets our usability goal that
            <i>the tasks should not be too irritating to accomplish</i>, which
            was the case then users had to answer questions that they didn’t
            find relevant to their interest.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Evolution 3: Reappearing Questions after custom Interval</h4>
          <p>
            Lastly, we noticed during testing that users that answered questions
            sometimes proceeded to stay on the blacklisted website for dozens of
            minutes. Since one of our main usability goals is to keep the user
            mindful whenever they’re on distracting websites, we decided to give
            the user the option to make the questions reappear after a select
            amount of time, a setting that can be changed in the settings, as
            indicated in the user manual. This also targets our usability goal
            that <i>the tasks should not be too easy to accomplish</i>, which it
            was when the user would only have to answer only one question before
            accessing the website. In fact, this feature makes the layer of
            friction slightly more predominant, and will be a reminder for the
            user to stay mindful during long periods of distraction
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>Revised Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            The revised version of our application (Beta) consists of all the
            changes mentioned above, as well as a few minor tweaks to increase
            usability.

          <h2>Updated User Manual</h2>

          <p>
            Please follow the
            <a href="pdf/revisedUserManual.pdf">Updated User Manual</a>
            to install and test our application.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several changes made to the system, and these are
            reflected in the user manual wherever the UPDATED tag is appended.
            The main changes to the user manual itself was the addition of an
            Introduction page, as well as a Uninstallation guide. We concluded
            that the user needed a more complete explanation of the purpose of
            the application, and presenting this on the first page would be
            optimal. Furthermore, we wanted to make the user's life easier in
            case they wanted to uninstall the app, which is why we added the
            section at the end. Furthermore, the entire settings navigation was
            changed towards a more "flowy" approach, where the user is guided
            through all the settings they need to touch from beginning to end,
            which is derived from the need to make the settings page more
            intuitive, as requested from the Feedback.
