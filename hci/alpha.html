          <h2>Design Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            The alpha system went through multiple evolutions and design changes
            that reflect the feedback received previously, as well as our own
            insights. The evolutions are as follows, in order of importance:
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>
            Evolution 1: Different Categories and Difficulties of Questions
          </h4>
          <p>
            The evaluators in our feedback reported that the questions
            <i>“felt too hard for the target users”</i>, which was students in
            general. In fact, they claimed that
            <i
              >“tough object-oriented programming questions like the ones in the
              prototype are not suitable for students that have not studied
              these concepts in general”</i
            >. We agree with this comment, and concluded that such a difficulty
            and niche of topic would decrease the usability of the system, and
            make it too hard to use for the average student. Furthermore, one of
            our main usability goals was that
            <i>“the system should not be too hard to use”</i>, and that the user
            should be able to accomplish the tasks under 60 seconds. To make
            this goal more attainable by the average student, we added
            difficulty levels for the questions, such as
            <i>“easy/medium/hard”</i> as well as different categories
            altogether, such as “spanish”, so that it’s not only bound to
            programming.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h4>Evolution 2: Randomized Questions</h4>
          <p>
            During the Hi-fi prototype testing, our evaluators noticed that the
            fact that our questions would always come in the same order defeated
            the purpose of learning. They noticed that the users would simply
            remember the order of questions that had appeared previously, and
            memorize the answer patterns, which
            <i>“defeated the purpose of the prototype”</i>. We agree strongly
            with this statement. It correlates with one of our usability goals,
            which was that
            <i>“the tasks should not be too easy to accomplish”</i>. Indeed, if
            the user simply remembers the answer’s in order, the task would
            become too easy, and our usability goal would fail. Therefore, in
            order to increase usability, we randomized the order of questions in
            the alpha version.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Evolution 3: Minimalized System Settings</h4>
          <p>
            From our own insights using the system, we noticed that the settings
            were far too complicated to get around once you could actually
            locate it. in fact, in our feedback, our evaluators highlighted that
            the
            <i
              >"amount of menus for so few functionalities intensified the
              plugin’s burden."</i
            >. We agree that our settings menu was indeed very cumbersome, and
            this decreases the usability of the system. In fact, one of our
            three main usability heuristics from Nielsen's list was "Aesthetic
            and minimalist design". In this revision, we concluded that having
            three different menus for such few settings decreased the aesthetic
            and minimalism of the system, and would therefore reduce usability.
            In order to remedy this, we combined the three settings menu into a
            single one, where the user can make all the necessary system
            modifications on the same page. This reduces confusion, and makes
            all the functionalities of the system immediately obvious to the
            user, which increases usability.
